## How does branching work in Git, and why is it an important feature for collaborative development on GitHub? Discuss the process of creating, using, and merging branches in a typical workflow.

How It Works:

Isolation: Creates separate lines of development.

Parallel Work: Allows multiple features or fixes simultaneously.

Main Branch: Typically main or master for stable code.

Importance for Collaboration:

Non-Interference: Developers work independently without disrupting main code.

Experimentation: Safe space for testing new ideas.

Code Review: Facilitates peer review before merging.

Typical Workflow:

Create Branch:

git checkout -b <branch-name>: Creates and switches to new branch.

Use Branch:

Make changes, stage (git add), and commit (git commit).

Push Branch:

git push origin <branch-name>: Uploads branch to GitHub.

Create Pull Request (PR):

On GitHub, propose merging branch into main.

Review, discuss, and approve changes.

Merge Branch:

Merge PR into main branch via GitHub interface or CLI.

git checkout main: Switch to main branch.

git merge <branch-name>: Merge changes.

Clean Up:

Delete merged branch locally (git branch -d <branch-name>) and on GitHub.

## Explore the role of pull requests in the GitHub workflow. How do they facilitate code review and collaboration, and what are the typical steps involved in creating and merging a pull request?

Facilitating Code Review and Collaboration:

Proposal: Suggests changes from a branch to main.

Review: Allows team members to comment, suggest improvements.
